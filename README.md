**Spotify: A Modern Music Streaming Powerhouse**

Spotify is a digital music streaming service offering access to over 82 million songs, podcasts, and audiobooks. Developed by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon in 2006, the app has become a household name, boasting over 457 million subscribers as of 2022. Competing with SoundCloud and Apple Music, Spotify has transformed how people listen to music.

Spotify gauges the popularity of its artists based on their monthly listeners and the number of streams their songs receive. These streams are monetized by multiplying the number of streams by $0.003, which is paid to artists as "royalties." This modern system equates 100 streams to one album sale, replacing traditional album sales. In 2019, Ed Sheeran was Spotify's most streamed artist, though rankings change rapidly with new album releases, EPs, and mixtapes.

Spotify's extensive dataset is perfect for analyzing the popularity of songs in relation to various musical elements across decades. This analysis can reveal how music tastes have evolved over the past two decades.
